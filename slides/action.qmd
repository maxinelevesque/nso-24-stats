## Learning about the world

 

The "ideal" science centers on the **experimental cycle**:

::: {.incremental}
* Start with **what we currently know** about the world.
* **Observe new data**.
* Use this data to **make inferences** that **update** how we view the world.

## Recall

The amount of information provided by a test result is called the result's **Bayes factor**, $K$. While the PPV—which is the **posterior probability** of disease given a positive test—changes depending on the prior, the following **ratios** are always proportional:

$$ \frac{\mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{actually }+ \mid \textrm{test }+)}{\mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{actually }- \mid \textrm{test }+)} = K\,\frac{\mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{actually }+)}{\mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{actually }-)}$$

So, the Bayes factor tells us how much receiving a positive test result **changes** our prior belief. Test results with larger Bayes factors **change our beliefs more**.

---

## In experimental design

The **posterior probability** of a model given data changes depending on the prior.

However, the following **ratios** are always proportional:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{model }1 \mid \textrm{data we see})}{\mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{model }2 \mid \textrm{data we see})} = K\,\frac{\mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{model }1)}{\mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{model }2)}
$$

So, the Bayes factor $K$ tells us how much receiving a positive test result **changes** our prior belief. Test results with larger Bayes factors **change our beliefs more**.

## What's in an experimental design

When we conduct experiments, we collect **data** that **updates** our beliefs about the world:

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
& \mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{model}) & \\
& \downarrow & \\
& \mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{model} \mid \textrm{data})
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

::: {.fragment}
When you design an experiment, you specify:
:::

::: {.incremental}
* what **data** you will **collect**, and
* how that will **update** your beliefs about your **model** with any outcome.

## Science as process {auto-animate="true"}

 

Do we really just do one experiment?

 

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
    & \mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{Statement}) & \\
    & \downarrow & \textrm{Get Data} \\
    & \mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{Statement} \mid \textrm{Data}) &
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

---

Let's say we run a second experiment with a second test. Now I can **update** my knowledge **again**:
 
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
    & \mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{Statement}) & \\
    & \downarrow & \textrm{Get Data 1} \\
    & \mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{Statement} \mid \textrm{Data 1}) & \\
    & \downarrow & \textrm{Get Data 2} \\
    & \mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{Statement} \mid \textrm{Data 1},\textrm{Data 2}) & \\
    & \downarrow & \\
    & \cdots &
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

And so on, for test after test.

\
Let's say we **update** our belief with successive tests, as above, but at each step, we choose the next test such that it will **maximally increase our updated probability**, $\mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{statement} \mid \textrm{tests})$.

That is, we choose the experiment that we think will **give us the most evidence supporting our model**.

## Comparing models

Let's say we **update** our belief with successive tests, but this time, we look at **multiple** candidate models; i.e., we obtain

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
    &\mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{model 1} \mid \textrm{test 1},\cdots,\textrm{test }n) \\
    &\mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{model 2} \mid \textrm{test 1},\cdots,\textrm{test }n) \\
    &\cdots \\
    &\mathrm{Pr}(\textrm{model }k \mid \textrm{test 1},\cdots,\textrm{test }n)
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

after a sequence of $n$ tests.

### Does the presence of multiple candidate models change the way we should choose the next test?

In the above scheme with multiple candidate models, let's say that the **truth** is **not** among the models that you considered.

## History dependence {auto-animate="true"}

The process of updating our beliefs about our model is kind of like an **optimization problem**.

Imagine that there is some "landscape" painted across the space of all models we're considering, with the "height" at each point (each model) corresponding to the "badness" of that model.

> For example, models are worse (higher up) if they have a bigger **prediction error**, lower $R^2$, etc.

The process of updating our beliefs about our model is kind of like an **optimization problem**.

Imagine that there is some "landscape" painted across the space of all models we're considering, with the "height" at each point (each model) corresponding to the "badness" of that model.

Our goal is to incrementally update what we *think* the best model is, in order to someday find the lowest point in the entire landscape—the **actual best** model—which should be the **truth**.

Maybe the suffering of the mentally different **arises from that very story** we tell them as scientists and as a society—

—the story that there is a disease to be cured.
